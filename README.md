# LibreOffice REST API

This project is a Stateless REST API that exposes an endpoint for document conversion using the LibreOffice CLI.

# Motivation

The motivation for this project was from the issues experienced from another service I was using at work for the same purpose, it had a large memory footprint on our clusters as a result of some zombie processes thereby leading to memory leakages.

There are three endpoint exposed on the project and they are as follows
